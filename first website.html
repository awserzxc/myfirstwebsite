                <p>The English language has Germanic roots, but more than half of its words have also been influenced by Latin, French, and some Scandinavian languages. 
                    English has become the most widely used second language in the world and the primary language of over 50 different nations. </p>

                <p>The formation of the languages in Britain that we can trace today began some 3000 years ago, when the Celts arrived. 
                    However, knowledge of the British languages during this earlier period in British history is limited. </p>

                <p>This Celtic influence on British language is still evident in modern times in the Welsh spoken in Wales and the Gaelic spoken in Scotland and in Ireland. 
                    Before the Germanic tribes came to the British Isles and introduced the language that would eventually become English, the region was populated by Celtic and Roman peoples.</p>

                <p>Old English is the term we use to describe the English language from c. 450 to 1100. Old English is extremely dissimilar from our contemporary English. </p>
                
                <p>With the language's growth spanning more than 1500 years, there have been several alterations.</p>

                <p>Although Latin continued to have a significant influence during the Roman era, the entrance of the Germanic tribes in 449 marked the official beginning of the English language. 
                </p>

                <p>One of these tribes, the "Angles," is the source of the words "English" and "England." Words from North Germanic origin also flooded into the English language, especially in the north of England, due to the Viking invasions, which started in around 850. 
                    This was a main influence on the creation and development of the Old English language. </p>

                <p>King Alfred the Great (871 to 900) put an end to the Vikings' dominance of England, and the majority of the invaders settled down with the English and converted to Christianity. Much of the Old English language that has survived today uses gender in nouns, while word order was not fixed and there was a great deal of freedom in how the language was used.</p>
                
                <p>With separate inflectional ends, four distinct cases (nominative, dative, accusative, and genitive), and gendered nouns, old English grammar is comparable to modern German grammar.</p>

                <p>Old English frequently relocated the verb to the end of the phrase in subordinate clauses, which is another similarity to modern German.</p>

                <p>Old English grammar was also notable for its lack of a word for "do" when forming questions, its abundance of double negatives (similar to those in modern Spanish), its lack of the letters J and W, and its lack of the letters V and U. In the late 6th century, the Anglo-Saxons converted to Latin Christianity. The adoption of parchment for record-keeping within the Church was one of the major cultural developments of this era.</p>

The adoption of parchment for record-keeping within the Church was one of the major cultural developments of this era.</p>

                <p>Prior to this, all writing was often composed of brief, straightforward engravings on wood or bone, with the earliest Anglo-Saxon inscriptions appearing around 450.</p>

                <p>Longer writings may now be written down thanks to the development of parchment, and the Church is the source of almost all of the remaining Old English literature. Old English texts include poetry, prose, maxims, and proverbs. The earliest Anglo-Saxon written texts are from the late 7th century. It was heavily influenced by both pagan and biblical traditions. The texts are difficult to date and hardly ever have an author listed. All of the earliest manuscripts are poetry that describe daring expeditions and thrilling fights.</p>

                <p>Old English poetry by the religious poets Caedmon (about 7th century) and Cynewulf have survived in some instances (9th century). The late ninth century saw the translation of numerous poems from Latin by King Alfred the Great.</p>

                <p>The most well-known Old English poem, Beowulf, is an epic story with more than 3,000 verses. Although it is believed that this text was first composed in the eighth century and subsequently updated in the tenth, the earliest extant manuscript of it comes from around the year 1000.</p>

                <p>here were four main dialects of Old English: Northumbrian, Mercian, West Saxon, and Kentish.</p>

                <p>The Northumbrian and Mercian dialects are frequently referred to as Anglian. These dialects originated in the North, the Midlands, the South West, and the South East, respectively.</p>

                <p>West Saxon had taken over and been adopted by the other regions by the end of the Old English era at the end of the 11th century. The vast majority of archival records from this time period are written in West Saxon.</p>

                <p>Although barely a sixth of Anglo-Saxon words—roughly 1% of the language as it is today—survived, the ones that did are extremely significant. that everyday English speakers utilize.</p>

                <p>They are "water," "strong," "food," "earth," "sleep," "you," "be," "not," "from," "and," "where," "wood," "house," "family," "brother," "daughter," "laughing," "first," and "moon." It's interesting to note that many curse words used now in English also have Old English origins.</p>

                <p>eaders of Old English language literature should be wary of these "false friends," as many terms resemble one another yet have evolved in meaning over time. For instance, "wif" (wife) denoted any woman, not only a married one; "wan" (wan) denoted darkness, not pallor; and "sona" (soon) denoted right away, not soon.</p>

                <p>Due to the Norman Conquest, which followed England's defeat at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, the English language underwent at the end of the 11th century, Old English was set to give way to Middle English.</p>
